         <h2><i>Lorde continues to mine the uncertainties of youth, the tribulations of romance, and an ambivalence toward partying on her revelatory sophomore album.</i></h2>

              class="clase5">
              <p class="clase3">Lorde always seemed destined for more than <strong> "Royals"</strong>. While her biggest hit to date introduced the world to her trademark minimal production and sharp, 
                casually caustic songwriting, the 2013 single never quite did justice to the young New Zealand singer's full appeal. Her unpretentious explorations of adolescence and life 
                transition were better expressed elsewhere on her debut, <strong>Pure Heroine</strong>, with songs like the earnest <strong>"Buzzcut Season"</strong> and the dark, doomed 
                teen romance of <strong>"Tennis Court"</strong>. These tracks pointed to an emerging, idiosyncratic artist who inflected radio pop with a rare strain of candidness, boldly 
                scaling her music to the proportions and limitations of everyday life where most went for stadium-sized universality.</p>
              <p class="clase3"> The release of her long-anticipated sophomore effort <span class="clase2">Melodrama</span> recalls the artistic trajectory of another singer who rose to pop prominence as a teenager, Fiona
                 Apple. If <strong>"Royals"</strong> was Lorde's <strong>"Criminal"</strong>, a smash hit that nonetheless elided her best talents, <span class="clase2">Melodram</span> is her When the Pawn Hitsâ€¦. 
                 While more pop-oriented and, ironically, less angst-ridden than Apple's masterpiece,<span class="clase2"> Melodrama </span> is a similarly incisive follow-up that hones the deeper cuts from her debut 
                 and functions best as a full album. </p>
              <p class="clase3">Lorde continues to mine the uncertainties of youth, the tribulations of romance, and an ambivalence toward partying as her primary source material. While the 
                triumphant piano pop of <strong>"Green Light"</strong> may have served as the world's rapturous introduction to the album, it is perhaps the moody, sultry <strong>"Sober"</strong> that best 
                encapsulates <span class="clase2">Melodrama</span> as a whole. The song introduces themes of interdependence and possessiveness, captured by a particularly colorful retelling of "Jack and 
                Jill", that surface regularly throughout the album, as on "The Louvre" and the unhinged ballad <strong>"Writer in the Dark"</strong>.</p>
